* ask permissions
* change icon
* wrong url for server => handle error
* change the type of page ranges to numeric
* deploy node app - *DONE*
* BUG: Open the app, select a printer and a file, print it, leave the app open, and then open a file explorer and share a file for printing => it should allow you to print that file, but instead is going to ask you to select a new file to print (because there is no dispatching done second time, because the app was already open). - *FIXED*
